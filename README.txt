E-BANKING WEBSITE

1.	Online banking is an electronic payment system that enables customers of a financial institution to conduct financial transactions on a website operated by the institution, such as a retail bank, virtual bank, credit union or building society. Online banking is also referred as internet banking, e-banking, virtual banking and by other terms.

2.	The website is designed using php and mysql.Users can log into their accounts,backed by a password facility.As soon as the users logs in,they can perform the required tasks.

3.	They can perform balance enquiry, funds transfer to another account in the same bank,facility to print the receipt of the available balance like a mini statement,viewing monthly and annual statements,providing user to view their last login to be free from threat.

4.	The customer should have a    valid user id and password to login to the system.When an invalid password is entered a warning is given to the user that his account is going to get locked or he can give forgot password and retrieve it by answering to the necessary security questions.After the valid user logs in he is shown the available balance in his bank account. He can also take a printout of the same. User can request for the details of the last ‘n’number of transactions that he has performed.

5.	 The whole system requires 5 tables in order to store the details gathered in every page. Email is kept as the mandate column and primary key in order to refer a particular person.

6.	The applications are processed in the administrator module.

7.	 Xampp server suits the best for compiling and executing the php code. Phpmyadmin supports in the creation and maintenance of mysql database and tables.

The project was developed as a part of the curriculum for the course IP lab(CS405).
